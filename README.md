Easy Caching plugin for Wordpress

##Installation
Copy the file from the wp-content folder to your wp-content folder.
That's it, the plugin doesn't even need to be activated, how cool is that?


##Notes
You need one of the supported caching extensions like redis, memcache, memcached or wincache.

Also, currently there is no way to configure the extenions, edit the code if you have some exotic setup ;-)
